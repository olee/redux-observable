If you&apos;re new to Reactive Programming with RxJS v5, head over to http://reactivex.io/rxjs/ to familiarize yourself first.\nredux-observable (because of RxJS) truly shines the most for complex async/side effects. If you&apos;re not already comfortable with RxJS you might consider using redux-thunk for simple side effects and then use redux-observable for the complex stuff. That way you can remain productive and learn RxJS as you go. redux-thunk is much simpler to learn and use, but that also means it&apos;s far less powerful. Of course, if you already love Rx like we do, you will probably use it for everything!\n\nAn Epic is the core primitive of redux-observable.\nIt is a function which takes a stream of actions and returns a stream of actions. Actions in, actions out.\nIt has roughly this type signature:\nfunction (action$: Observable&lt;Action&gt;, store: Store): Observable&lt;Action&gt;;\n\nWhile you&apos;ll most commonly produce actions out in response to some action you received in, that&apos;s not actually a requirement! Once you&apos;re inside your Epic, use any Observable patterns you desire as long as anything output from the final, returned stream, is an action.\nThe actions you emit will be immediately dispatched through the normal store.dispatch(), so under the hood redux-observable effectively does epic(action$, store).subscribe(store.dispatch)\nEpics run alongside the normal Redux dispatch channel, after the reducers have already received them--so you cannot &quot;swallow&quot; an incoming action. Actions always run through your reducers before your Epics even receive them.\nIf you let an incoming action pass through, it will create an infinite loop:\n// DO NOT DO THIS\nconst actionEpic = (action$) =&gt; action$; // creates infinite loop\n\n\nThe pattern of handling side effects this way is similar to the &quot;process manager&quot; pattern, sometimes called a &quot;saga&quot;, but the original definition of saga is not truly applicable. If you&apos;re familiar with redux-saga, redux-observable is very similar. But because it uses RxJS it is much more declarative and you utilize and expand your existing RxJS abilities.\n\nA Basic Example\n\nIMPORTANT: redux-observable does not add any of the RxJS operators to the Observable.prototype so you will need to import the ones you use or import all of them in your entry file.\nBecause there are many ways to add them, our examples will not include any imports. If you want to add every operator, put import &apos;rxjs&apos;; in your entry index.js. Learn more.\n\nLet&apos;s start with a simple Epic example:\nconst pingEpic = action$ =&gt;\n  action$.filter(action =&gt; action.type === &apos;PING&apos;)\n    .mapTo({ type: &apos;PONG&apos; });\n\n// later...\ndispatch({ type: &apos;PING&apos; });\n\n\nNoticed how action$ has a dollar sign at the end? It&apos;s simply a common RxJS convention to identify variables that reference a stream.\n\npingEpic will listen for actions of type PING and map them to a new action, PONG. This example is functionally equivalent to doing this:\ndispatch({ type: &apos;PING&apos; });\ndispatch({ type: &apos;PONG&apos; });\n\n\nREMEMBER: Epics run alongside the normal Redux dispatch channel, after the reducers have already received them. When you map an action to another one, you are not preventing the original action from reaching the reducers; that action has already been through them!\n\nThe real power comes when you need to do something asynchronous. Let&apos;s say you want to dispatch PONG 1 second after receiving the PING:\nconst pingEpic = action$ =&gt;\n  action$.filter(action =&gt; action.type === &apos;PING&apos;)\n    .delay(1000) // Asynchronously wait 1000ms then continue\n    .mapTo({ type: &apos;PONG&apos; });\n\n// later...\ndispatch({ type: &apos;PING&apos; });\n\nYour reducers will receive the original PING action, then 1 second later receive the PONG.\nconst pingReducer = (state = { isPinging: false }, action) =&gt; {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case &apos;PING&apos;:\n      return { isPinging: true };\n\n    case &apos;PONG&apos;:\n      return { isPinging: false };\n\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n\nSince filtering by a specific action type is so common, the action$ stream has an ofType() operator to reduce that boilerplate:\nconst pingEpic = action$ =&gt;\n  action$.ofType(&apos;PING&apos;)\n    .delay(1000) // Asynchronously wait 1000ms then continue\n    .mapTo({ type: &apos;PONG&apos; });\n\n\nNeed to match against multiple action types? No problem! ofType accepts any number of arguments!\naction$.ofType(FIRST, SECOND, THIRD) // FIRST or SECOND or THIRD\n\nYou can also use the ofType() operator directly as a lettable operator:\nimport { ofType } from &apos;redux-observable&apos;;\nimport { delay, mapTo } from &apos;rxjs/operators&apos;; // rxjs v5.5+\n\nconst pingEpic = action$ =&gt;\n  action$.pipe(\n    ofType(&apos;PING&apos;),\n    delay(1000), // Asynchronously wait 1000ms then continue\n    mapTo({ type: &apos;PONG&apos; })\n  );\n\n\nTry It Live!\nView this demo on JSBin\nA Real World Example\nNow that we have a general idea of what an Epic looks like, let&apos;s continue with a more real-world example:\nimport { ajax } from &apos;rxjs/observable/dom/ajax&apos;;\n\n// action creators\nconst fetchUser = username =&gt; ({ type: FETCH_USER, payload: username });\nconst fetchUserFulfilled = payload =&gt; ({ type: FETCH_USER_FULFILLED, payload });\n\n// epic\nconst fetchUserEpic = action$ =&gt;\n  action$.ofType(FETCH_USER)\n    .mergeMap(action =&gt;\n      ajax.getJSON(`https://api.github.com/users/${action.payload}`)\n        .map(response =&gt; fetchUserFulfilled(response))\n    );\n\n// later...\ndispatch(fetchUser(&apos;torvalds&apos;));\n\n\nWe&apos;re using action creators (aka factories) like fetchUser instead of creating the action POJO directly. This is a Redux convention that is totally optional.\n\nWe have a standard Redux action creator fetchUser, but also a corresponding Epic to orchestrate the actual AJAX call. When that AJAX call comes back, we map the response to a FETCH_USER_FULFILLED action.\n\nRemember, Epics take a stream of actions in and return a stream of actions out. If the RxJS operators and behavior shown so far is unfamiliar to you, you&apos;ll definitely want to take some time to dive deeper into RxJS before proceeding.\n\nYou can then update your Store&apos;s state in response to that FETCH_USER_FULFILLED action:\nconst users = (state = {}, action) =&gt; {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case FETCH_USER_FULFILLED:\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        // `login` is the username\n        [action.payload.login]: action.payload\n      };\n\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n\n\nTry It Live!\nView this demo on JSBin\nAccessing the Store&apos;s State\nYour Epics receive a second argument, a light version of Redux store.\ntype LightStore = { getState: Function, dispatch: Function };\n\nfunction (action$: ActionsObservable&lt;Action&gt;, store: LightStore ): ActionsObservable&lt;Action&gt;;\n\n\nThis is not a true reference to the full store object. It only contains store.getState() and store.dispatch(); it does not currently support Observable.from(store).\n\nWith this, you can call store.getState() to synchronously access the current state:\nconst INCREMENT = &apos;INCREMENT&apos;;\nconst INCREMENT_IF_ODD = &apos;INCREMENT_IF_ODD&apos;;\n\nconst increment = () =&gt; ({ type: INCREMENT });\nconst incrementIfOdd = () =&gt; ({ type: INCREMENT_IF_ODD });\n\nconst incrementIfOddEpic = (action$, store) =&gt;\n  action$.ofType(INCREMENT_IF_ODD)\n    .filter(() =&gt; store.getState().counter % 2 === 1)\n    .map(() =&gt; increment());\n\n// later...\ndispatch(incrementIfOdd());\n\n\nREMEMBER: When an Epic receives an action, it has already been run through your reducers and the state updated.\n\nUsing store.dispatch() inside your Epic is an anti-pattern and will be removed in v1.0.0 of redux-observable so it&apos;s best not to use it.\n\nTry It Live!\nView this demo on JSBinn\nCombining Epics\nFinally, redux-observable provides a utility called combineEpics() that allows you to easily combine multiple Epics into a single one:\nimport { combineEpics } from &apos;redux-observable&apos;;\n\nconst rootEpic = combineEpics(\n  pingEpic,\n  fetchUserEpic\n);\n\nNote that this is equivalent to:\nimport { merge } from &apos;rxjs/observable/merge&apos;;\n\nconst rootEpic = (action$, store) =&gt; merge(\n  pingEpic(action$, store),\n  fetchUserEpic(action$, store)\n);\n\nNext Steps\nNext, we&#x2019;ll explore how to activate your Epics so they can start listening for actions.\n"},"docs/basics/SettingUpTheMiddleware.html":{"url":"docs/basics/SettingUpTheMiddleware.html","title":"Setting Up The Middleware","body":"Setting Up The Middleware\nNow that we know what Epics are, we need to provide them to the redux-observable middleware so they can start listening for actions.\nRoot Epic\nSimilar to redux requiring a single root Reducer, redux-observable requires a single root Epic.

While there are several ways of doing this depending on your requirements, the most common way is to have your application dispatch a cancellation action and listen for it inside your Epic.\nThis can be done with the .takeUntil() RxJS operator:\nimport { ajax } from &apos;rxjs/observable/dom/ajax&apos;;\n\nconst fetchUserEpic = action$ =&gt;\n  action$.ofType(FETCH_USER)\n    .mergeMap(action =&gt;\n      ajax.getJSON(`/api/users/${action.payload}`)\n        .map(response =&gt; fetchUserFulfilled(response))\n        .takeUntil(action$.ofType(FETCH_USER_CANCELLED))\n    );\n\nHere we placed the .takeUntil() inside our .mergeMap(), but after our AJAX call; this is important because we want to cancel only the AJAX request, not stop the Epic from listening for any future actions. Isolating your observable chains like this is an important concept you will use often. If this isn&apos;t clear, you should consider spending some time getting intimately familiar with RxJS and generally how operator chaining works. Ben Lesh has a great video that explains how Observables work and even covers isolating your chains!\n\nThis example uses mergeMap (aka flatMap), which means it allows multiple concurrent FETCH_USER requests. If you instead want to cancel any pending request and instead switch to the latest one, you can use the switchMap operator.\n\n\nTry It Live!\nView this demo on JSBin\nCancel and Do Something Else (Emit a Different Action)\nSometimes you want to not only cancel a side effect (such as an AJAX call), but also do something else, like emit a totally different action.\nYou can achieve that using the aptly named race operator. It allows you to literally &quot;race&quot; between streams; whichever one emits a value first wins! The losing streams are unsubscribed, cancelling any operation they were performing.\nFor example, let&apos;s say that we make an AJAX call when someone dispatches FETCH_USER, but if someone dispatches FETCH_USER_CANCELLED we cancel that pending AJAX request and instead emit a totally different action - in this case, to increment a counter:\nimport { ajax } from &apos;rxjs/observable/dom/ajax&apos;;\n\nconst fetchUserEpic = action$ =&gt;\n  action$.ofType(FETCH_USER)\n    .mergeMap(action =&gt;\n      ajax.getJSON(`/api/users/${action.payload}`)\n        .map(response =&gt; fetchUserFulfilled(response))\n        .race(\n          action$.ofType(FETCH_USER_CANCELLED)\n            .map(() =&gt; incrementCounter())\n            .take(1)\n        )\n    );\n\nWe also need to use .take(1), because we only want to listen for the cancellation action once while we&apos;re racing the AJAX call.\n\nThis brings up a worthwhile consideration: instead of following up on the cancellation event with a separate action, could you just idiomatically repurpose the original cancellation action being absorbed by your reducers? In other words, is it better to rely on a single action that triggers both the cancellation itself, and what happens afterward, or to define two unrelated actions that reflect your intent? Optimal use cases vary from one implementation to another.\n\n"},"docs/recipes/ErrorHandling.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/ErrorHandling.html","title":"Error Handling","body":"Error Handling\nHandling errors in side effects like AJAX calls is a common requirement of Epics.

That means it&apos;s not an Observable, Promise, Array, doesn&apos;t support Symbol.observable, etc.\nThe following are some examples of that.\n(action$, store) =&gt; Observable.from(store)\nThe store provided to your Epics is the same one provided by redux to the middleware. It is not a full version of the store, so it does not support the Symbol.observable interop point to allow Observable.from(store). You can learn more about this here.\n\nTypeError: Cannot read property &apos;subscribe&apos; of undefined\nThis almost always means you&apos;re using an operator somewhere that expects to be provided with an observable but you instead did not give it anything at all.
